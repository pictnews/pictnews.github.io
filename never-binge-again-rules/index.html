<p>Never binge again is not a weight loss program. And since the typical client who engages with our program reduces their binge frequency by 90% in the very first month (see site for most up to date results), that means our program is likely to save you $335+ per month ($4,020 per year). I could never put my finger down my throat and so i didn't really have to develop techniques for never purging again. Seeing myself lose control like this was traumatizing to me and i never ever wanted to feel this way again.</p>
