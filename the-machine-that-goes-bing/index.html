<p>Phone phollies or the machine that goes bing! since the friday before memorial day we’ve been on “summer hours” at work, which basically means we get to leave at 3 on fridays. And that's what i kept thinking about today as i got all the tests that went bing, boink, buzz and every other onomatopoeia you can. Actually, i also got the search engine bit wrong, microsoft says bing a decision engine. In my memory it was that casual but it wasn't.</p>
