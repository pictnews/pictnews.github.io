Besides the sodium mentioned, it&#39;s also water weight from going from very depleted glycogen stores to topping them off. There are about 9 food calories in a gram of fat, so in theory you could gain one pound of fat (454 g) by eating some 4,000 calories more than you burn. The actual number may be closer to 3,500, so if you eat 500 extra calories per day for a week, you might gain a pound of fat. One day of binge eating may add a pound or two, but it&#39;s temporary water weight, not fat.
