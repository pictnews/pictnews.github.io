Binge drinking is the practice of consuming large quantities of alcohol in a single session, usually defined as five or more drinks at one time for a man, or four or more drinks at one time for a woman. Binge drinking is the consumption of large amounts of alcohol over 2 hours or less resulting in a blood alcohol concentration (bac) of 0.08% or 0.08 grams per deciliter of alcohol or higher. A single night of binge drinking has a number of other effects, especially at higher amounts. The national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration (bac) to 0.08 percent—or 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter—or higher.
